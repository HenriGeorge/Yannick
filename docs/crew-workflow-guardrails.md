# Crew workflow guardrails

Decision diagrams that turn a `cc-worktrees` crew session's recurring frictions into **branch logic**.
A retrospective lesson in [`lessons.md`](lessons.md) records *what* went wrong; the diagram below makes
the failure mode structurally hard to repeat. These are **crew-mechanism** guardrails — they apply when
a multi-pane crew is running, and live alongside the coordinator methodology in
[`../bin/cc-worktrees`](../bin/cc-worktrees) (`_crew_methodology`). The universal spine stays in
[`WORKFLOW.md`](WORKFLOW.md) / [`VERIFY-WORKFLOW.md`](VERIFY-WORKFLOW.md).

Inline Mermaid is canonical here (the repo's docs convention — no committed images).

## D1 — Coordinator dispatch loop  _(pane-transport specific — send-keys artifacts; N/A for team-v2's SendMessage-coordinated teammates (separate OS processes, not in-process — see CC-WORKTREES.md § Team-v2 for the lifecycle))_

**★ HARD GATE — NO IDLE WAIT (#107).** Blocking on one pane while another idle pane has ready work is a
**GATE VIOLATION** on par with GATE-1/GATE-2 — the #1 coordinator failure. *Before you run any `crew_wait`*
(foreground OR background) you MUST first scan `crew_status.sh` and, for EVERY idle pane, dispatch its next
input-ready / non-colliding / non-live-driving task — or explicitly `park` it with a one-line reason on the
BOARD. The coordinator must neither leave every other pane idle (wasted parallelism) nor "keep them busy"
by dispatching every phase at once — a reviewer with **no diff** or a verifier pointed at the **builder's
live server** is worse than idle.

**IDLE-FILL LOOP — the per-tick priority ladder** the hard gate enforces (after every dispatch AND before
every wait), for each idle pane assign the FIRST applicable: **`rolling`** (audit/verify the last diff) →
**`pre-spec N+1/N+2`** (research / test-design the next units) → **`on-call research`** (answer an open
data/surface question) → **`park`** (none apply: park with a one-line reason — idle ≠ silent, #105).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  W[About to crew_wait?] --> SCAN[scan crew_status.sh — enumerate every pane]
  SCAN --> S{An idle pane?}
  S -->|no| WAIT[Run crew_wait in the BACKGROUND]
  S -->|yes| T1{Input-ready?<br/>diff / built page / open question exists?}
  T1 -->|no| HOLD[park it with a one-line reason on the BOARD]
  T1 -->|yes| T2{Non-colliding AND<br/>non-live-driving?}
  T2 -->|no| HOLD
  T2 -->|yes| LAD[Dispatch by ladder:<br/>rolling → pre-spec N+1/N+2 → on-call research]
  HOLD --> S
  LAD --> S
  WAIT --> RPT[Report = show BOARD finish-lines + STATUS sentinels<br/>idle = done + reported, pull-based]
  RPT --> DN{Builder DONE?}
  DN -->|no| W
  DN -->|yes| ROLL[Rolling quality: auditor on diff +<br/>verifier as the ONE live driver]
```

Encodes **#107** (NO-IDLE-WAIT hard gate — fill or park every idle pane *before* you wait; blocking-while-idle
is a GATE VIOLATION), **#96** (idle-pane triage — only input-ready, non-colliding, non-live-driving phases),
**#103** (one live driver at a time), and **#105** ("idle" ≠ "silent" — render the pull-based report trail).

**AUTONOMY CONTRACT (#108).** The coordinator runs autonomously; the ONLY three sanctioned human pauses are
(a) **GATE-1 design sign-off**, (b) **cannot-converge** — GATE-2 still red after a bounded retry budget, and
(c) a genuine **scope fork** / destructive op / missing credential. Everything else proceeds and reports —
no "is this ok?" / "should I proceed?" round-trips.

## D2 — Dev-port ownership across worktrees

Run multiple worktrees/crews in parallel and two dev servers default to the same port; the second to
start can **seize** it, so `:PORT` silently serves the *other* worktree's app — verification then asserts
against the wrong codebase (a 404 on a route only your branch has). Detect by IDENTITY (the listener's
parent-cwd), verify on your OWN free port, and FLAG — the naive "kill whatever's on the port" clobbers a
concurrent human session.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  N[Need dev app on :PORT] --> L{lsof :PORT listening?}
  L -->|no| START[Start dev on $PORT for THIS worktree]
  L -->|yes| ID{listener parent-cwd == this worktree?}
  ID -->|yes| OK[Ours — use it]
  ID -->|no| SIB[Sibling worktree SEIZED the port]
  SIB --> ALT[Start on free alt port PORT+100, verify there]
  ALT --> FLAG[FLAG: PID + worktree to human<br/>NEVER kill the foreign server]
  START --> OK
```

Encodes **#103** (a sibling worktree can seize your dev port — detect by identity, verify on your own
port, flag never clobber).

## Dispatch & fresh-keyed wait  _(pane-transport specific — send-keys artifacts; N/A for team-v2's SendMessage-coordinated teammates (separate OS processes, not in-process — see CC-WORKTREES.md § Team-v2 for the lifecycle))_

The crew-ops failure: a pane reused one result file across P3→P4, and the wait matched the **stale P3
sentinel** and returned instantly — nearly reporting P4 "done" off an old line. The guard: wait until the
file's **mtime is newer than the dispatch** AND a **phase-marker** is present; only then read + verify it
matches the dispatched phase. A sentinel is fresh only if the file changed AFTER you asked. The
`crew_wait.sh` helper enforces this via `CREW_WAIT_SINCE` (mtime) + `CREW_WAIT_GREP` (phase marker).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["coordinator dispatches to an IDLE pane<br/>crew/dispatch.sh — RECORD dispatch time"] --> B["pane works, writes crew/role.md + STATUS sentinel"]
    B --> W{"FRESH-KEYED WAIT (#98)<br/>file mtime NEWER than dispatch AND phase-marker present?"}
    W -->|"no — only an OLD sentinel exists"| STALE["DO NOT ACT<br/>a stale prior-phase STATUS:DONE is a landmine — keep waiting"]
    STALE --> W
    W -->|"yes — genuinely fresh"| R["read + verify it matches the PHASE you dispatched"]
    R --> P{"implementer DONE?"}
    P -->|"yes"| ROLL["ROLLING PIPELINE (#96)<br/>auditor on git diff + verifier on suite/live IN PARALLEL<br/>while implementer takes the next unit"]
    P -->|"no"| NEXT["route the next phase"]
```

Encodes **#98** (fresh-keyed wait — never act on a stale prior-phase `STATUS: DONE`).

## Test-ownership partition at P3

When the implementer (TDD) and the verifier both produce tests, split by file so they never collide:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    CM["coverage map<br/>test-designer — advisory, writes NO test code"] --> IMP["implementer (TDD)<br/>unit cases in the tests-suite file"]
    CM --> VER["verifier<br/>e2e/*.spec.ts — a NEW, DISJOINT file"]
    IMP -. "never the same file at once (#99)" .-> VER
```

Encodes **#99** (partition test ownership by file — `git diff --name-only` confirms zero overlap;
extends the single-code-owner rule to the test layer).
